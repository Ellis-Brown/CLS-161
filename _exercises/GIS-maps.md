The three layers of this map are:
1. Gibbon Chapter 2, as a heat map
    - Low frequencies are light blue, the high frequencies are yellow.
    - Follows a blue->red->yellow gradient from low to high frequencies.
2. Gibbon Chapter 5, as a heat map
    - Low frequencies are light purple, the high frequencies are yellow
    - Follows a purple->yellow gradient from low to high frequencies.
3. The Roman Empire, from 200 AD.
    - Added as a very light (about 90% transparent) layer to show the extent of the Roman Empire.

The map is interactive, so you can zoom in and out, and click on the layers to see the pop ups.
