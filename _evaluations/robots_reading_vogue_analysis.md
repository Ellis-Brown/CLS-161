# Reflection
The digital humanties project I viewed can be found [here](http://dh.library.yale.edu/projects/vogue/). This website aggregates many findings on data from the source of Vouge magazines over many years, and presents interesting trends within the data. Overall, I found this project to be fascinating and well done, it leaves many questions and room for further exploration to the reader while presenting a clear explanation of the methodologies used, and why they were used in the data collection and presentation process.

1. What kind of project is this? A digital repository? GIS? Natural Language Processing? A tool?

    This project is a website, which compiles a set of processing of data taken from the cover of vogue magazines. Within the project there are 10 different collections of data sorted into the following topics:
    - Word Vectors
    - Cover Averages
    - n-gram Search
    - Topic Modeling
    - Advertisements
    - Statistics 
    - Student Work
    - Colormetric Space
    - FabricSpace 
    - Take a Memo
    - Slice Histograms 

2. Who is behind the project?
    
    The project was written by professors Linday King and Peter Lenoard from Yale University.

3. What are the project goals?
    
    The project goals is to use the vast amount of data available on the online magazine vouge, which has uploaded all of their previous and current magazines to the internet, and find and inspect trends within them. Some of these result just to interesting finds, but others can be used to analyze trends and how they are related to life at the time of printing of the magazines. 
    
    In this website, they do not explore in great detail the significance of their findings or the reasons behinds trends as much as they bring them to light. To elaborate on my example, the [Averaging covers in Vogue page](http://dh.library.yale.edu/projects/vogue/coveraverages/) generates images on the average cover, showing the average face, words, and writing on each magazine. ![An example image of average magazine covers can be seen here](http://dh.library.yale.edu/projects/vogue/coveraverages/197080.jpg) They talk about their method of aligning the covers by hand as part of the data cleaning process, getting the words to align "vogue" rather than just using the available data. This was important because some of the covers were scanned, already digitial, etc, and the words and cover did line up. Some had borders, some did not. They have a very thourough explanation of the process in which data is collected, communicated nicely for the reader to understand, but do not go further into the analysis of _why_ those trends may appear in the data. This seems like a wonderful point of expansion, as one could look to understand the correlation between vouge covers and another source of statistical data, to draw some conclusion. For example, how do the Vouge magazine covers relate to the popular fashion trends of each century, if at all? Or, how do the vouge magazine covers relate to the overall economic state of the country over the last 30 years, if at all?
4. What kinds of questions does the project answer?
    
    This project is more of an aggregation of data. They clearly explain methodology, and create interesting visual analysis of the data they collect, such as the data on topic modeling on frequencies and closeness of phrases, from all articles ever published in vouge. As seen on [their page here](http://dh.library.yale.edu/projects/vogue/topics/), these word cloud generated trends are fun and interesting to explore, but furhter analysis is once again not provided. They also reference the data collection again, explaining how the [Machine learning tool Mallet](https://mimno.github.io/Mallet/index) is used to parse the language in the magazine and generate these word closeness and frequencies.
5. What kinds of questions can the project be used to answer?
    
    - What type of trends are visible from the covers of the magazine? 
    - What was the popularity and the success of the magazine based on it's distribution over time?
    - They also link to student work, which has a particularly interesting report on "An Analysis of Vogue Fashion Photographyâ€™s Implications about the Female Face" by Christiana Wong, a student at Yale University. As the original website is more about data collection, and the linked projects go more into detail about drawing conclusions, one doing a digital humanities project would likely use the website as a secondary source in their own digital humanities project analyzing some trend where the information collected is relevant.
6. What technologies are involved?
    
    They use a wide range of tools to collect and present their data. For examlpe, they use data collection, image processing, machine learning, word frequency and closeness classification, imageplot plotting, statistical modeling and probability theory for analysis, word embeding for modeling text in a vector space, and many more. Since each of these are very technical in their own regard, and the project only reference some of the tools used, it is safe to assume they used __a wide range of data collection and analysis tools to find and present trends within their datasets__.
7. What are the strengths of the project?
    
    The data is well presented, and well explained. The grahics and interactive models published with their findings provide insight to trends and non-trends with the data, and lead to more questions about _why_ things are the way that they are. The projects inspire ideas in people as to what is possible using current machine learning, language processing, and technical tools.
8. How might the project be improved?
    
    I think the project reaches their goals they set out to do. I think an expansion on the project could possibly include analysis of unrelated things to find a possible correlation. For example, how do the movements on racial equality and income equality relate to the advertisements and articles published in vouge? Who does the intended audience of the magazine seem to be writing to, at different points in history? These are wonderful DH project topics that can be built off what research has already been done, using Yale's website as a secondary source in the research.
