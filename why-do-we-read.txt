Why do people read?

Firstly, people read automatically, as their brains decipher the characters and turn them into words, before the concious thoughts take place

I would say people choose to read for many reasons

To live, in the current world, one must interpret laws, tax forms, and other documents, meaning having someone who can read or being able to read is a pre-requesite for most things in most countries. So people learn to read as a result

However, most reading is not necessary. Reading is often by choice

I choose to read things for school, and read things for my work.

In the last few months, I haven't been reading very much outside of that, because I have no time
I don't have time to read social media, or books.

I do read every morning tech news, for about 2 minutes, as part of my daily routine.

I don't like reading because I have a lot of THINGS to DO , and it feels like I have no time to do them, so adding on reading to the 1-2 hours of free time a day isn't practical, when i usually am eating or with friends during that time
