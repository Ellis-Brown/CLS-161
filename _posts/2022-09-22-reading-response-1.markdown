# Reading and reflection blog posts

Throughout the semester you will be given an opportunity to reflect on course readings and class discussions. The purpose of these reflections is to deepen your understanding of course material and to gain critical reading and writing skills. These skills are fundamental to humanities research. The public facing nature of this assignment (and other assignments) will acclimate you to pubic facing scholarship, an ideal of digital humanities.

Each reflection will be posted on your DH portfolio in the form of a blog. Blog posts are to be approximately 300-500 words in length. These posts are not meant to summarize readings. Instead, you will identify the problem, question, or issue that the author is addressing. Following that, you will highlight 2-3 salient ideas from the reading. Lastly, you will articulate 1-2 questions inspired by the reading which are of interest to you. It is sufficient to raise the questions without answering them here.

Readings: 
- Chapter 1: _Introduction to the Digital Humanities_  & Chapter 2:  _The Originization of Humanities Research_ from The Digital Humanities: A primer for Students and Scholars by [Eileen Gardiner](https://www-cambridge-org.ezproxy.library.tufts.edu/core/search?filters%5BauthorTerms%5D=Eileen%20Gardiner&eventCode=SE-AU) and [Robakd G. Musto](https://www-cambridge-org.ezproxy.library.tufts.edu/core/search?filters%5BauthorTerms%5D=Ronald%20G.%20Musto&eventCode=SE-AU)

While reading through these chapters, there was a lot of discussion on what the humanities are, what the _digital_ humantities are, and why one would take the time to research them. However, with all of the discussion about the humanities, one particular idea stood out to me which is the question about how the digital humanities shape humanities research. 

    "...Do these changes reconstitue the way scholars work or are they merely helping scholars do what they would normally do, but more quickly and efficiently?" (Page 5, Introduction to Digital Humanities.) 

One example of a digital invention that revolutionized communication, information orginization, and the way that research could be done across all fields was the network of online card catalogs for libraries. This here could be seen as a large step forward in the ease of which humanities research and discovery was done, but is unclear if it is the _digitial humanities_ of today. The line between the humanities and the digital humanities is unclear. The use of computers to aid the humanities research did not mean a clear shift in the presentation of such research, just the way that it is done. One may describe this as digital humanities, but the computers just made discovering the artificats to research easier, but none of the analysis could be aided by the machine, just discovery of the data.

Following this, search capabilities on catalogs and search engines across larger databases would then begin to shift the nature of the research, where the information was generated from. While the sources, and ways of doing research are again being transformed, the authors write that "Again, one of the essential roles of the humanities historically has been to provide guidance to, and interpretation of, the world created by humanity."

However, returning to the quote from page 5, does the involement of computers at this level shift the fundemental ways humanities research is done? I believe the answer is yes. Much of the world __relies__ on the services provided by the web. The internet has become an important tool for most people in the world, integral in our lives, from bank payments with credit card, communication through WhatsApp, WeChat, and iMessage, or video sharing, education, jobs, and buisness. However, not everyone uses the internet frequently in their daily lives. I imagine that most people or scholars who are publishing humanities work are dependent on the services provided by technology, from orginization of information, to presentation of ideas, to what the focus of research is, its hard to claim that digital humanities is not changing the way humanities is viewed overall. 

I think overall, humanities as a field will forever be changed by the way people are now interacting with the world, because the focus of humanities is on humans! However, that is not to claim that the humanities has changed for everyone. I pose the questions: When the world is completely dependent on technologies, and they become so commonplace that their absence would be more unusual than their presence, does digital humanities replace the traditional idea of humanities going forwards? Should the study of humanities be seperated into two categories (digital and non-digital), if the world inheriently depends and runs on technology? Finally, is there a defineable line between digitial humanities and humanities at all?
