# Reading and reflection blog posts
Throughout the semester you will be given an opportunity to reflect on course readings and class discussions. The purpose of these reflections is to deepen your understanding of course material and to gain critical reading and writing skills. These skills are fundamental to humanities research. The public facing nature of this assignment (and other assignments) will acclimate you to pubic facing scholarship, an ideal of digital humanities.

Each reflection will be posted on your DH portfolio in the form of a blog. Blog posts are to be approximately 300-500 words in length. These posts are not meant to summarize readings. Instead, you will identify the problem, question, or issue that the author is addressing. Following that, you will highlight 2-3 salient ideas from the reading. Lastly, you will articulate 1-2 questions inspired by the reading which are of interest to you. It is sufficient to raise the questions without answering them here.
