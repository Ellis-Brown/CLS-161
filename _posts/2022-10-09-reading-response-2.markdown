# Reading and reflection blog posts

For this week's blog discussion, I talk about _[As We May Think](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/)_ By Vannevar Bush.

In the article, he speaks about the future and science of orginizing information, and the impact of organized information on the future scientific developments. He also goes into great detail about the possibility the future holds for record keeping, photography, and searching of archives. I personally enjoyed this article very much so, because the things said here are very relevant to today's life when such information **is** accessible to many people around the world, but the job of organizing the world's information is still an ongoing task - such as Google's recent attempts to improve their search engine across their locally held databases this year. This article was written over 40 years before the World Wide Web was created, and far before many digital computer technology was available.

This block of text stood out to me in particular, which talks about the reason why organizing information needs to be a priority going forward:
> "But there is increased evidence that we are being bogged down today as specialization extends. The investigator is staggered by the findings and conclusions of thousands of other workersâ€”conclusions which he cannot find time to grasp, much less to remember, as they appear. Yet specialization becomes increasingly necessary for progress, and the effort to bridge between disciplines is correspondingly superficial."

Bush also writes:
> "A record if it is to be useful to science, must be continuously extended, it must be stored, and above all it must be consulted"

Together, these ideas highlight an important claim by the author, that progression must come with the originization of information, so work can progress. As many smart minds are capable of producing useful output, finding the time to discover and read all new work is more time than people have available to them. Without the availability to such work and thoughts of others, then there is much less progress to be made. 
> "There may be millions of fine thoughts, and the account of the experience on which they are based, all encased within stone walls of acceptable architectural form; but if the scholar can get at only one a week by diligent search, his syntheses are not likely to keep up with the current scene."

I think the article poses some very interesting ideas, especially for one written in **1945**. What stands out to me is the relevance of these topics, the ability to record more important media into smaller devices, and ideas for orginization as compared to today's world using social media. There are clearly lots of sources of data, video and image can be sent around the world between users without worry. However, I would claim the biggest problem seen today is the circulation of fake news, and entertainment media that does not bring about any service to those who watch. Having records of many things is important, but being able to differentiate between real and maliciously generated fake records is not something we have solved as a society, and not something Bush considered in his article. He describes a future device, a "mechanized private file and library", which would be a desk that could find information for you. This wonderful future vision is equivalently seen in the home desktops, laptops, phones and tablets of today, which are indeed personalized machines with access to such great records. 

There is a great deal of thought into the purpose, function, and technical constraints of such a future machine, and we have something equivalent today: computers. However, what is not considered is the mixing of fake and real archives into the database of possible searches. I pose the question: With a world where many people can have different viewpoints, what is objective truth on a matter? And how does one share information when people do not agree on the information shared? While these questions are less applicable to scientific research - Newton's laws of physics such as `F = M * A` can be proven at home, if someone was doubtful - this question is more of a social one. Vannevar Bush describes the technical posibilities in his article, but now the problems posed are more social, of course backed and fuel by technology. Who decides what records are correct, and what does it mean to a society when many do not agree?
